# Retention Incentive Simulator

This project models and compares learner retention across multiple scenarios using incentive-based interventions. It combines an interactive **Streamlit app**, a **custom CSV uploader**, and an **explanatory Jupyter notebook** to help decision-makers evaluate the financial and behavioral impact of incentive strategies.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retention-incentive-simulator.git
cd retention-incentive-simulator
```

### 2. Create & activate environment

Using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n stlit_env python=3.9
conda activate stlit_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv stlit_env
source stlit_env/bin/activate  # Use `.\stlit_env\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Run the Apps

### Run scenario-based Streamlit simulator

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Run the custom CSV simulator

```bash
streamlit run custom_csv.py
```

---

## Open the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook retention_analysis.ipynb
```

The notebook includes:

* Clear markdown explanations
* Actions, observations, and recommendations
* Financial summaries and executive tables

## Sample CSV Format for Drop-offs

Upload a CSV like this for the custom scenario:

```csv
Month,Drop-off Rate (%)
1,5
2,5
3,25
4,10
5,10
6,10
7,10
8,10
```
